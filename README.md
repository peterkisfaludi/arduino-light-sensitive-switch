Turn on an LED when brightness goes below threshold

This code was used during a workshop for Learn To Code Seoul at the Google Campus in Seoul.

The participants had to implement similar features over the course of a 4 hour workshop, including building the HW

The project also demonstrates an interesting phenomena:
LEDs can be used to detect brightness as well as to emit light
